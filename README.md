## Points for improvement
- Coverage of automated tests, especially unit and integration tests.
- Use of SQLite as the local database.
- A more robust error capture and handling system.
- Centralization and management of isolates.
- Full cache coverage, to improve response times and reduce dependency on API calls.
- Performance and error monitoring and analysis in the app, implementing monitoring tools such as Firebase Performance or Sentry and crashlytics.
